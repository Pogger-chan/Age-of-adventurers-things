            <p>Precognition is the ability to see what lies ahead, piercing the veil of the future. Seeing things that most people cannot a Psion with Precognitive abilites can, to a limited extent, know the future; such a future is known by tracing it's roots from the present, and grows more mysterious and cloudy as such roots grow distance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Such a future can be changed by the actions of the present, particularly by knowledge of said future and action to prevent or change it. This is the function most often leveraged by Precognitive Psions, peering into the future to steer around courses they seek to prevent or steer toward a possible outcome they seek.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Stunning.</em></strong> (3 psi points): On a failed saving throw, the target becomes stunned until the start of your next turn. If the power effects multiple targets, select one target for this effect</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Thieving.</em></strong> (1 psi point): On a failed saving throw, you can draw from the target's mind a spell it can cast (from a Spellcasting or Psionics feature). You must be aware that it can cast that spell; the target retains the ability to cast the spell, but you gain the ability to cast the spell using your Psionics feature by spending psi points equal to the level of the spell (restricted by your psi point limit). You can know one spell in this manner at a time, and retain the ability to cast the spell for 1 minute or until cast. If the spell is one that restores hit points, you reduce your own hit points by the amount healed by the spell.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forming:</strong> The power forms into a melee weapon (like a blade). When you would make a ranged spell attack, making a melee spell attack instead.</li>

                <li><strong>Reaching:</strong> The power stretches out reaching for its target. When you make a melee spell attack, you can give a reach of 15 feet. When you make a ranged spell attack, you double its range.</li>
